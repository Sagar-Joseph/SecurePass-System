## 📋 Project Overview
This application helps users generate high-entropy passwords to improve their digital security. Unlike online tools that send data to a server, **SecurePass** runs entirely in the browser (Client-Side) using vanilla JavaScript, ensuring maximum privacy.

## ✨ Key Features (Modules)
The system is built with 8 distinct functional modules:
1. **Configuration Interface**: Custom sliders and toggles for password length (6-20) and complexity.
2. **Randomization Engine**: Uses algorithmic logic to generate unpredictable character strings.
3. **Strength Analysis**: Real-time evaluation of password quality (Weak/Medium/Strong).
4. **Visual Feedback**: Dynamic color-coded strength bar (Red/Orange/Green).
5. **History Persistence**: Automatically saves the last 3 passwords using `LocalStorage`.
6. **Clipboard Manager**: One-click functionality to copy passwords.
7. **Validation Handler**: Prevents generation if no character types are selected.
8. **Notification System**: User feedback alerts (e.g., "Copied to Clipboard").

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
